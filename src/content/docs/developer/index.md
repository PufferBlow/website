# Developer guide

You're building against the Pufferblow API, hacking on the
server, or writing a client. This section is for you.

## Start here

- **[Server architecture](architecture.md)** — runtime layout,
  boot sequence, manager map, request pipeline, auth, federation,
  voice, storage. The canonical "how the server works" document.
- **[Roles & privileges](roles.md)** — the per-instance role
  system, the full privilege catalog, and how custom roles
  resolve through the API to gate real server behavior.
- **[API reference](api-reference.md)** — auto-generated from
  the FastAPI app's OpenAPI schema. Includes how to view it on
  a running instance and how to regenerate the embedded copy.

## Building against Pufferblow

- **[Client (web + desktop)](client.md)** — the integration
  points the official Electron / React client uses, including
  the `pufferblow://` deep-link scheme, auto-updater, voice
  DSP wiring, and the localStorage cache strategy. Useful both
  for understanding the reference client and for building
  alternative ones.
- **[Python SDK](sdk.md)** — using `pypufferblow` to write
  bots and integrations. Brief tour of the client API, async
  variants, the decorator-style bot framework, and what's out
  of scope.
